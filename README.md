# FishSimulation
  A simulation of fish/bird movement (flocking) based on the 1986 "Boid" paper by Craig Reynolds

# About
  Recently I read a paper by Craig Reynolds entitled "Boids" (see link above) that modeled the "flocking" movement of birds/fish in computer simulations.
  I wanted to take a crack at making this using processing so here it is:
  
# Abstract / Summary
  Craig's paper details objects called "boids" that act as the birds or fish or whatever animal you are simulating.
  These boids have a detection radius, as well as a view angle that they can see.
  The boids use 3 "tenants" to choose how it moves and steers to immitate the flocking movement.
  These three tenants include:
    - Separation
    - Cohesion
    - Alignment
  Using these three tenants (which I detail more in their respective sections of development), we can simulate our desired movement
